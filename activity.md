# GitHub Workflow Activity


## Form teams

Work with your Project 3 team. If you are in a team of 4, form two 2-person teams.

Assign the following roles to the members of your team. If you are in a team
of 2, then both team members will take turns playing the role of the maintainer.

Roles:

- Maintainer: Creates and maintains a GitHub project.
- Contributor-1: Contributes to the GitHub project created by the maintainer.
- Contributor-2: Contributes to the GitHub project created by the maintainer.

## Overview

In this activity your team will play out several scenarios of concurrent development with GitHub.

## Setup the project

- Help your maintainer to create a new project on GitHub named `favorites` and add the other team members as contributors.

## Contributor-1 setup

- Help Contributor-1 to [clone](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html#clone) the project in NetBeans.

## First contribution

Help contributor-1 to follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/):
- [Create a new branch.](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html#branchCreate)
- Create a new file `favorite-foods.txt` that contains a couple of contributor-1's
  favorite foods.
- [Add and commit the new file.](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html#add)
- [Push](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html#push) the new branch to GitHub.
- On GitHub, [make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to pull the new branch into the master branch.

Help the maintainer to [merge contributor-1's pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request/) on GitHub and then [delete the branch](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-unused-branches/).

Help contributor-1 to switch to the master branch and [pull changes](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html#pull) from the remote master. Then, clean up by [deleting the local development branch](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html#branchDelete).

Congratulations, your team has made its first contribution! Celebrate.


## Contributor-2 setup and second contribution

- Repeat the steps above to have contributor-2 contribute a new file
  `favorite-movies.txt` with a couple of his/her favorite movies.
- Make sure that the maintainer has accepted contributor-2's pull request 
  and contributor-2 has updated their master and cleaned up.

Celebrate again.

## First synchronization

- Contributor-1's clone is out of synch. Help contributor-1 pull changes from GitHub into their local master branch.

Celebrate. But keep it small. Don't worry, there will be bigger celebrations later.


## Contribute conflicting changes

- Have contributor-1 and contributor-2 independently follow the contribution
  workflow to add another favorite food to the end of `favorite-foods.txt`.
- Maintainer, accept one of the pull requests. Try to accept the other. You
  won't be able to because changes in the pull request conflict with the other
  that you already accepted.
- Help the contributor with the unresolved pull request to pull changes from GitHub 
  to their local master branch and rebase their development branch. Then push 
  the development branch to GitHub.
- Maintainer, note that the conflicted pull request is automatically updated and
  should be acceptable. Accept the pull request.
- Have contributors clean up.

Celebrate enthusiastically. That was challenging.


## Multi-round contribution

- Have contributor-1 add another food, and contributor-2 another movie.
- Have the maintainer ask for a modification through the pull-request
  (e.g., "Please pick another flavor. I don't like chocolate.").
- Have contributors make, commit, and push the new changes.
- If the maintainer is satisfied, accept the pull-requests.
- Contributors, don't forget to clean up.

Notice how pull-requests provide a way for a contributor and a maintainer to
communicate about a proposed change. Also notice how the pull-request updates
automatically as new changes are pushed to the same branch.


## Squash

- Repeat the multi-round contribution until both contributors have made multiple
  commits.
- Maintainer, through the pull-request, ask contributors to squash their work
  into a single commit.
- Help contributors to [squash their commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) into a single   commit and push it. (Note you will have to use the command line.  NetBeans does not yet provide support for squashing commits.)
- Maintainer, accept the pull-requests once it contains the same work, but only
  a single commit.
- Contributors, don't forget to clean up.

This is another moment for an enthusiastic celebration. Well done!  

## Your sandbox

Troubles with Git?  The repository you created today is a safe place for trying new things.  Let me know if you have a scenario you want help figuring out.
